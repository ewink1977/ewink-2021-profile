<h2>a NEW profile for a NEW ewink!</h2>
<p>My current profile is designed to get me a job in video or in journalism. Now, I am a web developer,
and as such, I need a profile that reflects that!</p>
<p>This profile will more fall in line with what is expected of me as a developer. While it will be 
pretty much simple CSS/HTML, it will link to my projects and various other things that will hopefully
convince companies with lots and lots of money to hire me!</p>
<p>My current profile is at <a href="https://www.douglasavenue.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">douglasavenue.com</a>. 
It will be replaced by this one. Some of those files are in the inital Git Push, but will be deleted when they are no
longer needed.</p>
<h2>UPDATE!</h2>
<p>I have decided to start from scratch and make a Bootstrap centered profile, since the use of Bootstrap will be 
important for me as a fullstack developer!</p>
